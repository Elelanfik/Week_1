# Data Analysis and Quantitative Finance Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for a multi-step project focusing on financial data analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, and time series analysis, as well as quantitative financial analysis using tools like PyNance and TA-Lib.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Git and GitHub

- **Objectives:** Set up a Python environment, implement version control using Git, and establish CI/CD pipelines.
- **Key Analysis:** 
  - Perform EDA on the dataset (descriptive stats, text analysis, time series).
  - Sentiment analysis of news headlines and topic modeling.
  - Analyze publication trends and identify active publishers.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Set up GitHub repo, create and commit to the `task-1` branch.
  - Conduct EDA and text analysis, visualizing key findings.

### Task 2: Quantitative Analysis with PyNance and TA-Lib

- **Objectives:** Load stock price data and calculate key financial indicators using TA-Lib and PyNance.
- **Key Analysis:** 
  - Compute technical indicators (Moving Averages, RSI, MACD).
  - Visualize stock data and indicators.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Set up `task-2` branch for ongoing development.
  - Calculate and visualize technical indicators like Moving Average, RSI, and MACD.

### Task 3: Correlation between News and Stock Movement

- **Objectives:** Align stock price data and news headlines by date, then analyze the correlation between sentiment and stock movement.
- **Key Analysis:** 
  - Perform sentiment analysis on news headlines.
  - Calculate daily stock returns and test correlation with sentiment scores.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Set up `task-3` branch for ongoing development.
  - Perform sentiment analysis, compute daily returns, and analyze the correlation.
